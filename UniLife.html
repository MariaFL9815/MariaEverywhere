  <p> In today’s new media environment, publics are increasingly connecting with political groups through new media technologies (Sweetser, 2011), while social media has been touted as a mechanism for engaging key stakeholder groups, disseminating campaign messages and increasing candidate support (LaMarre & Suzuki-Holbrecht, 2013)</p>
  <p>The use of social media with political purposes has been going on for the past 20 years, but it is only in the last 5 years that social media has become a key player in political campaign strategies.  A recent study by brand republic stated that this key group is much more likely to discuss politics on social media than any other voter age group. 45% of first-time voter, social media users say they regularly use Facebook to discuss and read about politics, and 30% use Twitter to engage with the democratic process. This generation is also much less likely to engage with the election in more traditional ways such as writing to an elected official (13% of new voters versus 30% of the wider voting public), attending a public meeting (9% versus 23%) or join a political party (3% versus 10%) (Bran Republic: 2015). No wonder political campaigns such as Obama’s second term campaign, Britain’s 2015 elections, and the 2016 Brexit campaigns drove their focus and resources to social media.</p>
  On the recent Brexit campaign, both #VoteLeave and #BeLeave campaigns where neck-to-neck in outcomes in YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter outcomes. This essay will go in depth on the #BeLeave campaign, and the different ways they approached young voters and their outcomes respectably.
  <p>The Waterloo Strategy (email): ‘Predict the European Championships and win £50 million- the amount we send to the EU every single day’. This strategy had two outcomes: showing the £35o million figure to young men who do not usually vote. In addition, to get the contact information of the participants. Vote Leave’s database gained 120,000 names. In total, Vote Leave sent out half a million texts in the final 24 hours on the campaign reminding people to vote.
  Data war:</p>
  <p>Campaigns use data-mining techniques to analyse the electoral roll, ‘scraping’ information from people’s social media account to build a model of a campaign’s target voters. In this area, the Remain camp had Jim Messina, who had run Barack Obama’s re-election effort in 2012, and was one of the main reasons the Conservative party managed to win on 2015.
  Facebook: six out of ten people in Britain have an account.</p>

  <p>For example, we have captured 30 weeks of data from Instagram, analysing over 18k users and 30k posts. This data indicates that not only were there twice as many Brexit supporters on Instagram, but they were also five times more active than Remain activists. The same pattern could be found on Twitter, where we found that the Leave camp outnumbers the Remain camp 7 to 1. The online momentum of the Leave camp was equally evident in the support they received from the community. On average, Instagram posts from the members of the Leave camp received 26% more likes and 20% more comments, while the most active users in the dataset were also all campaigning for a Leave vote. Furthermore, the top 3 most frequently used hashtags in the data come from the Leave camp and were well integrated into all networked conversations online: #Brexit, #Beleave and #VoteLeave. Using the Internet, the Leave camp was able to create the perception of wide-ranging public support for their cause that acted as a self-fulfilling prophecy, attracting many more voters to back Brexit.</p>

  <p>This can be explained by a combination of factors. First, the main Leave camp message was much more intuitive and straightforward, which is particularly important for social media campaigning. Second, their message was also highly emotionally charged, which facilitated the viral spread of Leave ideas. There is evidence to suggest that high arousal emotions such as anger and irritation spread faster than messages focusing on rational or economic arguments, particularly on social media. In this regard, we have observed many instances where people expressed utter confusion about the economic arguments on both sides. Considering that the reasons for Leaving were more emotional and that the average Internet user was exposed to a deluge of Brexit posts on a daily basis — both from friends and strangers online — we warned that a British exit vote could be a real possibility.</p>

  <p>Remain lost the battle online long before it lost the political battle on the ground. The overwhelming Leave sentiment across all social networking platforms was consistent and undeniable, yet many Remain supporters chose to ignore the voice of the Internet as something that has no connection with the real political world. They believed that Britain would never vote to leave the EU and discounted social media as a playground for trolls and teenagers.</p>

  <p>This study provides campaign strategists and political public relations professionals with quantitative evidence that social media efforts produce both online and offline benefits that can help achieve key campaign goals. Not only does social media engagement with a campaign predict greater online participation in the campaign, but it also predicts offline voting. This is important, as fundraising and voting are key political engagement goals. Due to the zero-sum nature of politics, itis imperative that campaigns not only spread their messages and fundraise, but also mobilize voters on Election Day. The results of this study suggest that social media engagement with a candidate can help campaigns achieve both of these goals.</p>
