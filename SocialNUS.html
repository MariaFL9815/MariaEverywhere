        <h2 class="blog-post-title">NUS National Conference</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 28, 2019 by <a href="Contact.html">Maria</a></p>

        <p> My very last national conference as an undergrad. Oh, how time flies.</p>
        <p>Find out more about NUS National Conference and my journey to Glasgow last year here. </p>
<p>There are three main things I want to talk about on this post:</p>
<p>1.	A contrast between NC last year and this one.</p>
<p>2.	How does conference makes me feel. </p>
<p>3.	A summary of what happened at this year's conference.</p>
<p>Last year I was more "innocent" and exited for the conference. But also had zero clues of what being a delegate actually meant and what I could do with my "power". I didn't know the importance of inner politics and the fact that addressing everyone as "conference" when speaking on stage, is normal and not a grammar error that kept bugging me.
<p>I actually took active action towards what I proposed on my manifesto. You see, I thought my manifesto was to show the students my values and the causes I cared the most about. As can be seen here: </p>
<p>But in truth, it can also be about what you want to change and what are you going to do about it. So, this year, once I learned that I could submit motions myself (MMU) I decided to do something about my manifesto promises. </p>
<p>I was lucky enough that when we met with the other delegates to agree on what ti submit, they all believed in the issues that I stood for as well, and as a team we came up with the motion. In all honesty, i could' have done it without them, specially without Andy, Amy and Zxian. I feel like I had an idea without knowing how NUS motion writing truly was and that even though I cared about a concept and some main goals/objectives, they had actual knowledge about the issues and added the content necessary to make them strong motions. These can be found here: </p>
<p>2018 Conference: I arrived with barely any friends and not a proper grasp of the influence of NUS in the UK. </p>
<p>2019 Conference: I arrived and had dinner with some friends from another (UEA) and had two motions I felt passionate about going to be presented. I knew who was running for national elections and who to vote for. </p>
Conference made me feel empowered. Because I think that sometimes we skip that hard issues that don't necessarily affect us. We turn the other cheek and hope for the best. And in many ways, this conference made me think about these massive issues that affect the UK and NUS and remember where I stand. </p>
<p>I went from being opinionated to stand for what believe in and be vocal about it on Twitter. And this, this was the most amazing feeling I thought I had left behind with my debating days. </p>
<p>Something (new to history) happened this year: an all-women office was elected for NUS. </p>
<p>But because this is a personal blog, I shed a tear or two when the first motion MMU presented passed. </p>
<p>This is because this cause is dear to my heart, around May last year a good friend of mine told me about this issue they were having, and I didn't know how to help. I told them that if I got elected as delegate again, I would push forward a motion, but that was so far away. They went to talk to the societies and development officer at our uni and a campaign is in th works for our campus! So, when the motion passed, after a yearlong search for someone to listen and have the recourses to do something about it, I was so happy. </p>
<p>The second motion comes from an issue I have seen around my campus since my first weeks as a fresher. I lived with mostly teachers and nurses- to be in a house of 12. The thing about these degrees, along with physiotherapy and x and y... is that they have mandatory unpaid placement they have to complete to graduate. They have to work for like half their degree without even getting expenses paid AND pay the exam same university feees for half the education. Seeing my flatmates work tirelessly while the rest of the freshers were partying and enjoying their first year motivated me to do something about it. </p>
With both motions passing, I felt useful as a delegate, like I've done something right. I felt I "fulfilled" my role, I talked to the people on campus and took the steps towards making their voices heard.</p>
