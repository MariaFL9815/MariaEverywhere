        <p>Feeling at home used to mean to be in my country.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Feeling at home used to be about my friends from my childhood and my mum&#39;s homecooked
meals. <a href="#".</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>That feeling change around three years ago when I moved to England and home stopped
being a location or people around me, but rather this feeling of belonging that you find in the
smallest of situations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This week I felt at home when I attended an event called #WeAreInternational Student
Forum. The event was organised by UKCISA (UK Council for international student affairs)
in London. At that event, I learned a lot of things about the international student scene; there
was something one of the speakers (Rex Bechu) said that really stuck with me-
 how we come to UK to find romance, and in the end, we end up falling in
love with the country instead.
“We are not one group of people,” she told the crowd, “but we are all passionate about this
country”.
But without getting too cheesy, I’m going tell you a bit about this event because I think
international student affairs is one of the topics I could talk about for hours or even days.
I have so many thoughts about policy structure- what’s fair and what&#39;s not, what should be
done and what is being done right. So at this event I had the magnificent opportunity to voice
all those thoughts out loud -not just to say into the air and hope for the best, but to share them
with a group of people there not only could challenge my ideas and concepts and make me
think critically but also with people that could implement these ideas and ado something to
change the international student experience in the UK.
Caring about international student affairs was never part of my identity. My nationality didn’t
use to be part of my personality and now I see how much influence it has. Being from
Argentina means that I am so many different things like chatty, always late, and sometimes
overly cocky...We discussed the impact of stereotypes at the session called xxxxx
At this session, we discussed volunteering and the importance of giving back to the
community. Which was quite a controversial topic to me because when you hold a Tier 4
Student Visa, you are only allowed to work 20 hours during term time, and this INCLUDES
volunteering. This means if I need a part-time job for either experience in the industry or
paying bills, giving my time to the community could stand in the way of my professional
development. Which to me works as a deterrent effect. Why would I want to give, when you
would penalise me for it?
This sort of concept of the work the way Visas and visa sponsorship works harms students as
much as future employers. The system feels so rigorous it makes me feel like sometimes the
country doesn’t want me to stay; which is really hard.
Luckily we were able to talk about this with a representative from the British Council. I feel
so happy to meet someone from there, as I have interacted one too many times with them
online... We got the opportunity to talk to him and to say that we felt. The points I
mentioned: <p>

<p>1. Rather than focusing on the Postgraduate work Visa permit as it would only work for
two years, focus on educating employers on Visa sponsorships making it more
feasible for employers to sponsor international students.<p>
<p>2. Educate employers on the benefits of hiring bilingual people from different cultures.
Make it simple and tempting. Sell us to them.<p>

<p>There is a lot to learn from listening to experts on the field. I think we often forget how big of
a movement this is and how there can be the multiple ways we can tackle the same situation.
For instance, Dr.Knut Schroeder has developed an app for international students using
different campuses in the UK that helps them when they have questions about their campus,
their resource, NHS resources and more, you can find it here. On the other hand, Dhruv
Krishnaraj and has developed a website called Student Circus where you can access job
adverts for international students.<p>

<p>So, the lingering question is, what can we do? <p>

<p>If you are a UK citizen and you are reading this right now what you can do is approach
international students; show us your culture. Integrate us, tell us about the silliest things you
can think of, because to us they are incredibly interesting and fascinating (Like pancake day
and boozing day). Tell me about the fact you go to the pub at 4 pm every day and the
different between lager and Guinness, and why does this matter at all. Don’t be afraid to
speak to me, and if my English is broken teach me- It is as simple as that that.
All you need to do to be an ambassador for your country is to share with us, in return, we will
share back. This does not have to be serious or formal, is as simple as just saying “let’s go to
the pub”, “let’s go hang out at the students union and grab a coffee”. That is enough and that
can make such a massive difference.<p>

<p>One of the issues with this is that home students and international students hang out in
different groups, which makes sense, since we tend to hang out with people we feel we have
things in common, and being -not British- is something that bonds us. But the truth is, it is
incredibly intimidating to approach people that are so different to oneself - especially when
you are new in a country. I know a lot of people travel from different parts of the UK and
have also just left their homes, but the cultural shock and speaking in a different language
make everything a bit more intimidating.<p>

<p>It goes both ways. We all had to do a little bit individually to make an impact in our
campuses. What I want to do is to go and say this exact same thing to every single student in
my campus. Will I be able to do this? Probably not, but I’m going to try because this is one
of the most important things we need to do if we want to be in an international campus in
international cities such as Manchester. We need to act, and we need to act now. The whole
point of attending an international university is to get an international education and that goes
beyond let the lecture theatre. It is about how we interact within a community and how we
expand our minds.<p>

<p>So personally, I invite you to go find someone from a different nationality than yours today
and talk to them. I bet you’re going to find out some pretty awesome things.
I’m going to talk with UKCISA to spread the work of the #WeAreInternational campaign to
Manchester Metropolitan. I want us to find multiple ways in which we can be a bit more

international and a bit more welcoming- so we can make everyone feel a little bit more at
home..</p>
