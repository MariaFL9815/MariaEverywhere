        <p class="blog-post-meta">March 23, 2019 by <a href="#">Maria</a></p>

        <p>This essay examines the role of online influencers within digital marketing and society in the digital era.  Digital Marketing is constantly changing, mutating onto different areas, evolving hand by hand with the internet and the different generations that utilise it.  It has also become crucial to marketing and for some the new way of marketing altogether. Digital Marketing is about people (marketers) connecting with other people (consumers) to build relationships and ultimately drive sales (Ryan,2017)</P>
        <p>The essay also looks at the way in which online influencers are identified and how their influence is measured.</p>

 <p>“People have been trying to influence other people since the dawn of existence, utilizing whatever means and media they had at their disposal at that time\” (Ryan:2017) One of the oldest ways of marketing is Influencer marketing, dating back to the 19th century. Chaffey and Ellis Chadwick (2016) define influential marketing as ‘identifying key communities and opinion leaders who are likely to talk about products and have the ability to influence the opinions of others.’ Furthermore, “84% of marketers said they would launch at least one influencer campaign in the next 12 months’ (SmarthInsights, 2016). According to Dellarocas (2003) word of mouth is one of the oldest ways of conveying information and has been defined in many ways. Katz and Lazarsfeld (1966) define in one of the earlies definitions that WOM is the exchanging of marketing information between consumers in such a way that it plays a fundamental role in shaping their behaviour and in changing attitudes toward products and services. Today’s new form of online WOM communication is known as electronic word-of-mouth or eWOM (Yang, 2017). This form of communication has taken on special importance with the emergence of online platforms, which have made it one of the most influential information sources on the Web (Abubakar and Ilkan, 2016) Marketing evolves along with society, thus, a new face of influence marketing emerges, Online Influencers.</p>

<p>No less than 10 years ago one could reach almost anyone thought television and Newspaper’s ads; now almost 3 billion people are active social media users (Global Digital Statshot Q2, 2017) Online Social Networks (OSN), are the new key field of marketing. Motivated by the need for effective viral marketing strategies, influence estimation and influence maximization have become important research problems, at the intersection of data mining and social sciences (Easley,J. Kleinberg, 2010)</p>

<p>Online influencers are defined as opinion leaders. Chaffey and Elis-Chadwick (2017) state that ‘Online influencers are key communities and opinion leaders who are likely to talk about products and have the ability to influence the opinions of others.’ They have the virtual-ear of the online masses Ryan (2017) mentions how blogs, podcasts, forums, and social networks harness the power of the web and can improve a brands image as well as harm it with their opinion on certain products. Andrew McStay, on the other hand, states that they are thought leaders of people’s peer groups used to corny credibility and reach audiences. </p>

<p>Online influencers can be bloggers, vloggers, online niche communities, experts and celebrities or anyone with a high level of engagement on any type of social media. One of the main characteristics of an online influencer is their reach. They need to have a large audience across multiple channels. This can be explained by the influence network model by Tuten and Solomon (2013) which emerges from the original framework called the two-step flow model (Katz and Lazarsfed, 1955) This proposes that a small group of influencers are responsible for the dissemination of information because they can modify the opinions of a large number of other people. What the influence network model provides is that the true influence is less driven by online influencers and more by interaction among those who are easily influenced. The second main characteristic is relevance. The influencer has to be right for the audience targeted and positive perception from this specific group. The last main essential quality an online influencer needs to cover is a high engagement level. An influencer’s high follower count means nothing if their audience is not engaged (Ryan,2017). Engagement is needed for a two-way conversation to develop, for a prior relationship with the followers to exits. It is a matter of trust building; if the followers trust the influencer’s opinion, likes and dislikes, they will be more likely to invest in the product promoted.  There are different influencer tools online, like Empowered, Linkdex or MajesticSEO that can help identify the ideal online influencers that hold the characteristics required for the brand.</p>

<p>Bandura, one of the main social-science theorists responsible our understanding of how people react in social situations, wrote, “In the social learning system, new patterns of behaviour can be acquired through direct experience or by observing the behaviours of others (Bandura, 1971). This explanation reflects on why influencers play such an important role in society.  Bandura states, “On the basis of informative feedback, they (consumers) develop thoughts or hypotheses about the types of behaviour most likely to succeed. These hypotheses then serve as guides for future actions” (Bandura, 1971).  Companies are using their resources via social media influencers in hopes that the experience that a consumer has with an influencer allows the behaviour of the influencer to be adopted, that is, copied by the consumer (Forbes, 2016). </p>

<p>Influencers allow brands to build a broader relationship with an audience that through more traditional communication means. One of the main benefits they provide is visibility and awareness. As can be seen in the buying pyramid, awareness is key to the conversion from ‘No’s to ‘Yes’s, it adds to the perception of a product and increases the sales. Visibility also triggers a ripple effect; as mentioned in the influence network model, it generates free publicity from secondary and third level users that are linked to the online influencers. They also provide a face to the brand’s campaign, build a stronger relationship, making the product more relatable and more trustworthy; consumers now buy the person’s lifesltyle and experiences as well, not just the product. The online influencer can also be used as the brand’s representation on social media; instead of starting accounts from scratch and attempting to gain the same number of followers and level of engagement, the online influencer functions as an online rendering of the brand with a generally more engaged audience for content. Lastly, they provide a possibility of a rapid rise in sales. Influencer statistics of 2016 from eMarketer show that over 80% of marketers who had undertaken campaigns collaborating with social media influencers found them effective for driving both engagement and awareness.</p>

<p>The main drawback of online marketing is that there are no guarantees; messages, can be misunderstood and can backfire towards the brand. For example, the latest Pepsi add shows how a message backfired completely and ruined the entire campaign. For a brand to rely on the research, the background research must be extensive and therefore, expensive as well. What is most expensive is the influencer’s fee: a tier 1 level influencer (lifestyle blogger for example) can charge up to £5K per post, along with social promotional collaborations. Furthermore, certain online influencers demand certain attention from high-level representatives of a brand, creating an additional cost of time and resources. Because online influencers are in their peak moment, most of them are already linked with several brands, and this can break one of the main benefits they provide, trustworthiness, which leads to a loss of authenticity. Estimates show up to 25%* of influencers have paid for fake followers from illegal bot farms (Like-Wise, 2018). Which creates a flaw in the concept of “transparency and real-ness” that the influencer is supposed to provide. </p>

<p>Existing studies evaluate the effectiveness of influence measures when the social network structure is completely known (Zhang, 2013). In these studies, the influence measures of each node are obtained from a complete social network, and nodes that are highly ranked with respect to the measures (e.g., the top 1% of nodes) are extracted as influencers. Then, the influence of the extracted nodes is analised by using models of influence cascades, such as the susceptible–infected–removed and susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) models Zhang, X, 2013) or by using actual records of information cascades (Pei S, 2014)</p>
However, as Borgatti mentions, it is difficult to obtain the complete structure of a real social network given they typically contain several errors due to missing data, false data, or node/link sampling from the social network (2006). Such incompleteness in social networks should affect the effectiveness of influence measures for identifying influencers. Because of this, it is not always easy to tell the difference between real engagement and fake/bought engagement. In 2018, the company social chain launched the first marketed service for companies to be able to know if their influencers are “real”. Their software, “Like-wise” identifies the influencers that have bought their following and/or faked their engagement, so brands do not get scammed and do not expect for results that are not going to reflect on their marketing strategies (Like-Wise, 2018). This tool could further reduce the drawbacks of using influencer marketing. </p>

<p>The new trend that is reducing the drawbacks mentioned is ‘micro-influencers’ which are people who only have a few thousands of followers. They are less expensive than the tier 1 influencers and hold a higher level of engagement and the results are measurable. The result of a recent study that focuses primarily on instream conducted by Markerly (2016) shows the efficiency of micro-influencers. After an analysis of over 5 million posts of users with over 1000 followers or higher, they found that out of those with less than 1000 followers received likes on their posts 8% of the time; while users with more than 10 million only received likes 1.6% of the time. The study resolved that the ‘sweet-spot’ of micro-influencers is someone with followers between 10k and 100k; this will provide a stronger engagement and broader reach. Further reducing the drawbacks previously mention and enhancing the benefits.</p>

<p>Truth is that online influencers are now key players in the online marketing strategy field, and they are gaining a bigger spotlight by the minute. Electronic world of mouth is not something to be undermined by businesses, as it travels quicker and, when used correctly, can have incredible results.  Society is slowly shifting its attention from the physical world onto the digital world, and it a marketer’s job to understand this and evolve with it. </p>
